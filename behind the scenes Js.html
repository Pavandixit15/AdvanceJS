    <h2>How Javascript code  is executed <b>Javascript parser & engine</b></h2> <br>
    <p> <h3>:- So javascript is Always Hosted in  Environment and  that is Most typically browser such as Chrome , firefox , safari etc  , This is Where javascript Runs , <br> <br>  
    :- there can  also be other hosts such as Node js  web server or even some  Applications  that accept javascript code input</h3>
   <h3> :- so we will concertrate on browser so when we Write JS code and want to run  the code there is lot of stuff happening behind the  scenes ,So what happens is that the host where JS is hosted it has somekind of Javascript Engine that takes our code and  executes it </h3> 
   <h3> :-The Javascript engine is a  Program which executes Javascript code , There are Many different Engines are there like googles V8 engine and  many more </h3> 
   <h3>:- The first Thing that happens  inside  the Engine is that our code is Parsed by Parser which basically reads Our code line by  line and checks if the syntax of the code that we gave it is correct , that is means the Parser know the Javascript rules & how  it has to be written in order  to be correct</h3>
   <h3>and if we make a mistake it will throw a error and  stops the execution if eerything is correct though then  the Parser Produces a data structure known as a abstract syntax tree which is then translated to machine  code which  is executed directly by the computers processors and it only when our code already converted to a  machine code actually runs and does it work</h3>
   <h2>Different engines do things in  a slightly diffferent way</h2>
        <h3 style="text-align: center; color: firebrick;">Execution context and Execution stacks</h3>

        :- <h4> All Javascript  Codes Need an Environment to  run the code and this environment is called Execution context , it is also can called as container which stores variables  and in which a Pieace of code is evaluated or executed        </h4>
